# WetSchematics

Sponge Schematic Parser. Visit https://github.com/SpongePowered/Schematic-Specification/ for more information about the format.
This parser can read schematics and write schematics in all versions of the format. It can also be used to convert between versions.

With the bukkit module the parser can be used to place schematics in bukkit worlds.
